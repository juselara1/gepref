GEneral PREprocessing Framework (gepref)
========================================

``gepref`` is a lightweight framework designed for constructing machine learning preprocessing strategies tailored for various data types such as texts, images, tables, and more, utilizing multiple backends.

.. note::

   The core library of ``gepref`` comprises solely of **interfaces** and **generic classes** aimed at facilitating the construction of preprocessing pipelines. It does not contain specific preprocessing implementations. For ready-to-use examples, refer to the libraries developed atop ``gepref``.

The following libraries utilize ``gepref`` for handling different data modalities:

* `gepref_text <https://github.com/juselara1/gepref_text>`_: This library specializes in text preprocessing, integrating natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
